# Country Statistics Fetcher
## A fully functional program written in python that can return any one of 8 statistics of a country
This program incorporates the use of the REST Countries API, which allows the program to fetch real time statistics of a country. This program:
- Asks you what country you want to research
- Give you a list of statistics you can search 
- Uses the API to access real time statistics and outputs it

## üíª How to run 
1. Clone the repository

2. (OPTIONAL) Create and activate a virtual environment
```

.\venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows PowerShell
```

3. Install the required package

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works 
1. It asks for a country name input
   
2. It then sends a request to the REST Countries API to fetch data from that country
   
3. It lists the available statistics
   
4. User chooses a statistic 

5. The program fetches the statistic from the API and prints it
