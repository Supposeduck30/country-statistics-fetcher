# Country Statistics Fetcher
## A fully functional program written in python that can return any one of 8 statistics of a country
This program incorporates the use of the REST Countries API, which allows the program to fetch real time statistics of a country. This program:
- Asks you what country you want to research
- Give you a list of statistics you can search 
- Uses the API to access real time statistics and outputs it

3. It lists the available statistics
   
4. User chooses a statistic 

5. The program fetches the statistic from the API and prints it
